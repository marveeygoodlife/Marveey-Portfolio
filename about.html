            I am Marvellous Ediagbonya, an
            <i>International Relations undergraduate</i> with a growing passion
            for <i>website development</i>. <br />

            I hail from Edo State Nigeria. As someone that is passionate about
            web development, I like the creativity and problem-solving that
            comes with building stylish and user friendly website. <br />
            <br />
            I love that I can turn a challenge into a dynamic experience online.
            From writing Html code, styling with Css to ensure it's beautiful,
            and using JavaScript to ake the webpage interactive with users I
            take pride in every step of the development
            <process class="br"></process> <br />I am someone that loves to
            learn from others, so collaborating with other developers to
            brainstorm, debugg, share ideas and build something greater than
            what one person can do is a goal that I aim to accomplish. I believe
            one can achieve excellent result by exchanging of knowledge,
            receiving constructive feedback and mutual support. I'm commited to
            working in a team to achieve outstanding success.

          <p class="contactp">
            Aside Web development I am a life-long learning, I enjoy learning
            and Reading books on diverse knowledge. Additionally, I love
            Travelling, living healthy, staying fit and helping people in anyway
            I can.

            I bring a unique perspective, combining an understanding of
            international dynamics with tech proficiency. I am looking to gain
            experience in roles where I can leverage both my academic knowledge
            and my web development skills to support innovative projects.
